# This script reads the configuration file and provides an interface for acessing 
# its data
#
# Config files can include others using the syntax
# 
# something = include something.conf
# 
# In this case, the contents of something.conf will be read, comma-separated
# by line, and returned when the "something" element is references.
# 
# This feature is most useful when including long lists of things to be used 
# in drop-down menus and the like
